 step 1  define 4 functions add, sub,mul,div

 var 1st num = 0 ;

 var  2nd num = 0 ;

 var  operator= "" ;


 step 2 
                  initial_value  = 0
                    function display {
                    for class numbers
                    if number buttons   are pressed 
                        initial_value += number buttons value  
                        screen_value = initial_value
                }      

       1st number = [if  at first number buttons are pressed
                    display on the display bar ]   or  display()


   
     operator variable  =   if  (any of these  * ,+,- ,/  ) are pressed 

    after storing operator  
    when the number is pressed
    1ts number =  initial value   
     clear the previous display screen   and      
    display the numbers  on the screen as we press those numbers   before pressing equal  store those number in 2nd num    
    before pressing   
     equal to sign =    

 ;

 step 3  function  operate(1st num ,operator ,second num){


     when equal to is clicked operate function  is called 

     

if equal is pressed  = "="{
       check for operator value 
       
       if operator = "+"{
        
      return  display the result [  add(1st ,2nd )]
      
                     and so on }
} 


  }

------------------------------------------------
     initial value  = 0 
    
    function display_screen {
    if numbers are pressed 
    initial value += numbers

    if any  operator(+-*/) are pressed 
    store  operator variable
    first number = initial value
    if numbers  are pressed 
    second number +=  i  {

        if equal  is pressed 

        function call operate( ){

               if (1st_num !=0 && operator!=""  and  2nd num= 0){

                     perform  add or sub or mul  
                               initial value 0
                                2nd_num=0
                        
                        display add ,sub , mul ,div



               }
         }
